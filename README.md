## Installing

1. Download the latest version of [Minecraft Forge](https://maven.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/1.12.2-14.23.5.2860/forge-1.12.2-14.23.5.2860-installer.jar) for the corresponding 
Quantum Minecraft version (1.12.2).
2. Download the latest Quantum build by going to the [releases](https://github.com/MrBubblegum/quantum-continued-continued/releases) section.
Do NOT install the jar that contains `sources`. That one contains the source code and isn't compiled.
3. Place the Quantum jar into the `.minecraft/mods/` directory. If you want to organize by Minecraft version, 
you can place it under `.minecraft/mods/{mc.version}` where `mc.version` is 
the version of Minecraft running (ex: `.minecraft/mods/1.12.2`). NOTE: This is will not work for 1.13+ version! You can
only put the mod jar in the `/mods` folder!
4. Launch Minecraft using the Forge profile. Quantum should now be loaded.
